# Computer-Network-Mini-Project
Hotel Topology in cisco packet tracer

1.The main objective of this project is to design network topology for hotel and to provide facilities to customers such as internet and calling. 

2.This Hotel Topology included 4 floors in each floor contain 10 computers and 2 ip phones (This is made virtually in cisco packet tracer). 

3.In this we have used concept of subnetting for assigning ip to Computers.Natting is used for accessing google server. 

4.Subnetting enables the network administrator to further divide the host part of the address into two or more subnets.  

5.Network Address Translation (NAT) is designed for IP address conservation.It enables private IP networks that use unregistered IP addresses to connect to the Internet.  

6.NAT operates on a router, usually connecting two networks together, and translates the private (not globally unique) addresses in the internal network into legal addresses, 
before packets are forwarded to another network. 

7.Hardware Requirement:
Personal computer/Laptop       
Operation system: Windows 7 or advance       
RAM: 3GB       
Hard disk:320GB   

8.Software Requirement:
Cisco packet tracer 7.2 

9.Conclusion:
We have learnt new concepts like natting and ip phone configurations,did subnetting in cisco packet tracer.
